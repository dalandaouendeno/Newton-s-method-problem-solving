Newton’s method to solve a two dimensional system

"""""""""""""""
Problem 2: Use Newton’s method to solve the two-dimensional system
    x**0.2 + y**0.2 - 2 = 0
    x**0.1 + y**0.4 - 2 = 0
    
For this problem, set an initial guess of (x, y) = (2.0, 2.0) and allow the error tolerance level
at tol = 1e - 6. You can set the maximum iteration at your discretion
